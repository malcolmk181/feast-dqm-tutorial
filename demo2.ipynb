    "### trips_stats.parquet\n",

    "Driver statistics for a taxi service. Each column corresponds to a driver's statistics for the day, given that they had at least one trip. The columns are: `'taxi_id', 'day', 'total_miles_travelled', 'total_trip_seconds', 'total_earned', 'trip_count'`\n",

Please bear with me, I have zero data science experience, so these features are arbitrarily chosen without regard and the code to get there (in demo.ipynb) is NOT ideal lol. Anyway, the columns are: `'taxi_id', 'day', 'trip_count_1_to_10', 'trip_count_11_to_25', 'trip_count_26_to_50', 'trip_count_51_to_100', 'trip_count_101_or_higher', 'total_miles_0_to_10', 'total_miles_10_to_25', 'total_miles_25_to_50', 'total_miles_50_to_100', 'total_miles_100_to_250', 'total_miles_250_to_500', 'total_miles_500_to_1000', 'total_miles_1000_or_higher', 'seconds_0_3600', 'seconds_3600_to_7200', 'seconds_7200_to_14400', 'seconds_14400_to_28800', 'seconds_28800_to_43200', 'seconds_43200_or_higher', 'earned_0_to_50', 'earned_50_to_100', 'earned_100_to_250', 'earned_250_to_500', 'earned_500_to_1000', 'earned_1000_or_higher'`\n",

    "Now that we've retrieved the data for the last 7, 30, and 90 days from July 1st, 2019, we want to see how July 1st compares to these different time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I thought this might be doable by creating a saved dataset for July 1st and creating a profile for it. Then I would have used this profile to validate the previous time periods. However, since profile parameters are based off the reference dataset, this would mean I would be looking for changes from the new day of data, when I really want to see if today has changed from the previous time periods. For example, I may want to see if the mean value of `trip_count_1_to_10` has changed by more than 10% from the mean value of the last 30 days, but with a profile based off the single day of data, I would be testing if the 30-day mean was more than 10% different than the single-day data, which is not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, I would need to create a saved dataset and profiler for every different time scale, which equates to lots of data being re-saved to s3 and then needing to be thrown out again and multiple functions that are functionally very similar, but with slightly different parameters. The multiple profilers could actually be solved easily using partial functions, but creating multiple saved datasets takes time and requires file creation and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I am not certain that we actually want to do data quality monitoring on the returned `RetrievalJobs`, as they are point in time jobs, and we really just want to look at the raw feature data. What also makes this annoying is the fact that calls to `get_historical_features` requires a set of entities, and we have no interest in the entity ids, just the general distributions of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, even if we pursued this option, there is no way to adjust the parameters based on the size of the non-reference dataset. If we receive a day of data that is really small, then the distributions could be thrown way off, simply due to noise and overall lack of data. In effect, without being able to adjust for the size of the data, the constraints on distribution changes would need to either be too big to minimize false alarms, leading to possible missed alerts - or the constraints being too tight, and causing false alarms whenever the data size is smaller than normal."
