    "### trip_stats.parquet\n",

    "Driver statistics for a taxi service. Each column corresponds to a driver's statistics for the day, given that they had at least one trip. The columns are: `'taxi_id', 'day', 'total_miles_travelled', 'total_trip_seconds', 'total_earned', 'trip_count'`\n",

Please bear with me, I have zero data science experience, so these features are arbitrarily chosen without regard and the code to get there (in demo.ipynb) is NOT ideal lol. Anyway, the columns are: `'taxi_id', 'day', 'trip_count_1_to_10', 'trip_count_11_to_25', 'trip_count_26_to_50', 'trip_count_51_to_100', 'trip_count_101_or_higher', 'total_miles_0_to_10', 'total_miles_10_to_25', 'total_miles_25_to_50', 'total_miles_50_to_100', 'total_miles_100_to_250', 'total_miles_250_to_500', 'total_miles_500_to_1000', 'total_miles_1000_or_higher', 'seconds_0_3600', 'seconds_3600_to_7200', 'seconds_7200_to_14400', 'seconds_14400_to_28800', 'seconds_28800_to_43200', 'seconds_43200_or_higher', 'earned_0_to_50', 'earned_50_to_100', 'earned_100_to_250', 'earned_250_to_500', 'earned_500_to_1000', 'earned_1000_or_higher'`\n",
